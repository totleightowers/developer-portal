### Overview

The Cloud Platform automatically collects and stores your application logs, and lets you access them via an AWS-Hosted [OpenSearch].

### Log Collection

Logs are collected via [Fluentbit], which is a cluster-wide log collection service, with read permissions across the whole cluster. As long as your application logs to `stdout`, your logs will be collected.

### Log Storage

The logs are shipped to an AWS-Hosted OpenSearch cluster. All application logs are retained for 30 days.

### ModSec logging

If you have enabled ModSec WAF then the ModSec Audit logs are sent to a different OpenSearch cluster.

For more details and instructions to enable ModSec [see here](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/networking/modsecurity)
